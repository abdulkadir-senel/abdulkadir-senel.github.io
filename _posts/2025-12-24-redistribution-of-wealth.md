Every new year, the wealth of most wealthy people is getting more and more. The increase in the wealthiest's wealth is much faster than the poor get wealthy. Fifty years ago, the top 10 percent had 50 percent of the wealth; today, the top 10 percent have 70 percent of the wealth. Thus, the poorer get poorer and the richer get richer.

For that reason, the poor will struggle even more to buy even a car, let alone a house. Compared to 50 years ago, today we live a tremendously better life. Do we? Mobile computers are in our pockets, and we have fast cars, nice food, clean places, AI, and tons of fun content to consume. And other household items that make our lives easier are cheaper than 50 years ago. But the other thing is that having a house has gotten harder and harder, even though houses are being built tremendously.

The thing is, the wealthier can get houses much easier than the poor, and so they will get the houses, because for the wealthier, investing in a house is an excellent opportunity since the house price goes up every time. Now, there are a lot of wealthy people who have thousands of houses, and adding another to this empire is not a big deal. But for a poor person, buying any house is extremely difficult because the wealthier are wealthy, and they will get the house very easily, and so they will get it, and the poor will stay homeless.

If this vicious cycle continues, the situation of the poor will continue to get worse.

Ending this vicious cycle needs reform. The wealth should be redistributed. A wealth transfer is needed. There are two options to do this. One is for the wealthier to do it voluntarily. The second is for the redistribution of wealth to happen forcefully. It is well known that the first option will never work unless human nature changes. Saving assets to guarantee one's and one's offspring's survival is fundamental to human nature. It is instinct. So, unless human nature changes, the wealthiest will not share their wealth. There are absolutely some exceptions, but the exception is tremendously small compared to the part that is not shared.

So, the solution is apparent in the second option: redistribution of wealth with force. Now, one form of force is taxes. The other force is war. Start with war: as we saw in WW1 and WW2, wealth was redistributed by the force of government—the ones that are local government or the ones that are remote with the hands of other governments. It is clear that the wealthy themselves changed dramatically after the war, and not just their identity changed, but also the amount of wealth they possess changed more dramatically.

But as we know, war hits the poor harder than the wealthy.

So, the option of tax is necessary. This tax or extra tax needs to be just for the wealthier. The necessary wealth amount to be eligible for this wealth tax is 3 ounces of gold: if you exclude all of your yearly necessary expenses and debt and one house and one car, and if you still have an extra 3 ounces of gold, you are wealthy. You need to give 2.5% of your wealth. Below that, you are not eligible to be taxed. It can be found where this tax formula is used.

But in order for this tax option or any wealth tax option to work, most likely there will be a need for war again. Because if one country imposes a tax on the wealthier and the others do not impose it, the wealth will move to the country that does not impose the tax. Even if there remains one country that imposes 1 percent less tax than other countries, the wealth will move there.

Every country should impose the tax at the same amount and at the same time. Every country will not impose tax at the same rate, because countries would love the wealth to move to them.

Now, this makes war necessary again. But this time, war does not solely mean literal physical war. Maybe economic and political war can work. If the strongest country forces every country to impose a wealth tax with economic pressure, this can work.

So, the basic formula can be that there should be a supreme strongest country, and this country imposes a wealth tax and will compel other countries to impose a wealth tax at the same rate. The power to impose wealth tax.

But the power dynamics make this system very fragile. So, in order for power to control the redistribution of wealth more accurately, this power should be everywhere, and this means that the country that is powerful enough to impose taxes should be everywhere, and this means taking control of everywhere.

Without war, it can happen, but just in theory.

So, in every case, the redistribution of wealth needs war.
