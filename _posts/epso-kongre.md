Beyond the Ivory Tower: Optimizing Vocabulary Learning for the Real-Classrooms


Özet
Language teaching has evolved significantly over the last five decades specially with the introduction of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT). Today, a variety of instructional practices arise from CLT oriented approaches. Vocabulary teaching in particular has undergone major development. Methods such as contextualization and elicitation of lexical items, target-language-dominant instruction, increased student–student interaction, and authentic vocabulary use have made vocabulary learning more efficient and multi-channelled. However, a large population of language learners still does not benefit from these practices. Many contemporary methods are not easily implementable in realistic classroom environments, especially in resource-limited contexts. As a consequence, many learning settings continue to rely on traditional vocabulary memorization to promote lexical acquisition and to simplify assessment for instructors. Blaming teachers or repeatedly promoting CLT-based narratives does not solve this persistent inefficiency. There is a need for methods that remain applicable in classrooms that continue to use classical techniques. One simple yet powerful way to increase the efficacy of vocabulary memorization that is used in most of the classroom in real life is to encourage learners to memorize multi-word units rather than isolated words. This can promote more productive internal language development, because multiple neurological lexical connections are formed simultaneously, facilitating faster and more robust establishment of the target-language lexicon system in the brain.
